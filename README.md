In this project I created a React weather app, which uses an API from openweathermap to get weather information all over the world.You can use search to find the current weather of a city, for example Delhi or Paris. The app displays local temperature, Humidity, wind speed, and much more.
Enter the name of any city around the world and press enter to get its weather deatails.
